# GraalVM Mini Workshop

This is a very small step-by-step workshop/tutorial to get a feel for compiling
Java source code to native executables (or native images) using [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org).
The executables produced will be self-contained, and does not require any JDK installed on the host
in order to run, and works just as any other program or command you run in your terminal.

<summary>How to progress</summary>

In this workshop you start from a base tag <code>task1</code>. You have the option if you want to checkout
<code>task2</code>, <code>task3</code>, and so on when you finish a task, or if you just want to move on from your
current working tree keeping your own changes as you progress. Unless you for some reason
need to "reset" to a clean working state, just using your own working tree for the whole
workshop is recommended.

As you progress through the workshop, you end each task with clicking a link to the next task.
This will bring you to the appropriate tag at GitHub, and you then have the option to compare your
own solution with what is suggested as a solution in this repository. Just inspect the current commit.
E.g. if you have finished <em>Task 1</em>, and clicked to progress to <em>Task 2</em>, you can then view the current
commit you see on GitHub to compare your solution to <em>Task 1</em> with the suggested solution, should you want to.
